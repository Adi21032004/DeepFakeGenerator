# DeepFakeGenerator
A PyTorch implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained to generate realistic human face images using the CelebA dataset.

## 🔍 Overview

This project uses a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture to synthesize new, realistic-looking face images from random noise. The model is trained on the [CelebA dataset]

## 🚀 Features

- PyTorch-based implementation
- DCGAN architecture for high-quality image generation
- Custom Dataset and DataLoader for CelebA
- Modular Generator and Critic (Discriminator) networks
- Optional Weights & Biases logging

## 🧠 Architecture

The GAN consists of:
- **Generator**: Learns to produce realistic images from random noise vectors.
- **Critic**: Learns to distinguish real images from fake ones generated by the Generator.

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **CelebA**: Large-scale face attributes dataset with 200k+ celebrity images.
- Download it manually or via the Kaggle API and place in `./data/celeba/img_align_celeba`.
